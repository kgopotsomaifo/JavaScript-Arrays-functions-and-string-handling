Caesar cypher

# Description:

This programme is a cypher.
The cypher is to use the 15th letter after the letter you want to use. For example, ‘a’ will be ‘p’. Bear in mind that the letters are treated as cyclical. That means that ‘p’ will be coded to ‘e’ (the 10th letter after ‘p’ is ‘z’, so 5 letters after that will be ‘e’ because the cycle starts again).
